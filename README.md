if you want to run the file locally clone the directory first then go to the forontend and backend folders separately and run this command to install all the dependencies:
```powershell
nmp install
```
and then in the backend folder run:
```poweshell
node server.js
```
then in the frontend folder run:
```powershell
npm run dev
```
